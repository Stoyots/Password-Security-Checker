# Password Security Checker

Password Security Checker is a simple yet effective web application designed to ensure the security of your passwords. It checks that your passwords meet certain security criteria, such as length, presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Afterward, it compares your password against a database of 2.7 million banned, leaked passwords, etc., to ensure it's not vulnerable.
